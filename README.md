Basic loop:
1) Generate Energy either through recording and processing brainwaves (EEG headset required!), or manually by turning a crank (Little clickable object in the "Batteries" pane. Then, store Energy as Power in your Batteries
2) Use available Power to run your Mints to make Coins over time
3) Use available Power to grow Leaves for your tree to boost how much Energy is converted from brainwaves, or use available Coins to buy Battery Capacity upgrades to increase the amount of Power you can store
4) Repeat!

More features and flash to come
